# Time-domain-processor-project

A custom-designed processor that operates in the time domain using pulse-duration encoding for enhanced noise immunity, power efficiency, and security

 🚀 Overview
This project introduces a Time-Domain Processor, a novel approach to digital computation where binary data is encoded using pulse durations rather than conventional voltage levels. 

🔹 Noise-Resilient
🔹 Power-Efficient  
🔹 Security-Enhanced

 📜 Features
- Implements a **custom instruction set** for time-based computing.
- Supports operations like `ADD`, `SUB`, `MUL`, `SHIFT`, `INVERT`, `COMPARE`, and more.
- Verilog-based HDL implementation.
- Verified using test benches and simulations.

🛠 How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
https://github.com/om-mahesh/time-domain-processor.git
2. Compile and simulate using ModelSim / Vivado:

3. Observe the waveform outputs.

 🏆 Results & Future Work
- Successfully simulated key operations.
- Future improvements:
- Optimize power consumption.
- Extend support for additional operations.
